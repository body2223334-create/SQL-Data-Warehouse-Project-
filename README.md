📊 Data Warehouse (DWH) Project
🏗️ Project Overview

This project is my first attempt at building a Data Warehouse (DWH) following best practices in modern data architecture.
The goal is to create a single point of truth for business data by applying concepts such as:

🟤 Bronze Layer → Raw data ingestion

⚪ Silver Layer → Data cleaning & standardization

🟡 Gold Layer → Business-ready data for analytics

🔑 Key Features

🗄️ Data Modeling → Dimensions & Facts design (Star Schema)

🆔 Surrogate Keys → Consistent primary keys in dimension tables

🔗 Foreign Keys → Linking facts with dimensions

🏷️ Naming Conventions → <SourceSystem>_<Entity> for consistency

💾 Historical Data Management → Tracking changes in data

🛠️ Tech Stack

🐘 SQL (Core language for building schema & queries)

🟦 Azure (Data storage & services — cloud-based)

🐙 GitHub (Version control & repository management)
